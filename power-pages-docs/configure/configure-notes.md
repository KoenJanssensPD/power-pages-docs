# Configure notes as attachments for basic and multistep forms

The following steps walk through the process of enabling the ability to add attachments to basic and multistep forms using the Portals Management app.

You can also enable adding attachments using the Power Pages design studio. See [Enable attachments on a form](../getting-started/add-form.md#enable-attachments-on-a-form) and [Enable attachments on a multistep form](../getting-started/multistep-forms.md#enable-attachments) for more details.

## Configure notes as attachments using Portals Management app

To add the ability to view notes and attachments on basic and multistep forms, you'll need to complete the following steps:

- [Enable attachments for the table in Microsoft Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-create-entity#create-a-table).

- Add the [timeline control](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control) to the Dataverse forms through the model-driven app [form designer](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-design-forms) or [Data workspace](data-workspace-forms.md) if using the Power Pages design studio.

- Configure [table permissions](../security/table-permissions.md) for the notes (annotations) table.

> [!NOTE]
> - In order for a note to appear on the web page, the description of each note must be prefixed with **\*WEB\*** (*'WEB' keyword with an asterisk sign (\*) before and after*). Notes added through a form on a webpage will have the prefix automatically added.\
The filtering of notes appearing on portals, is configured through the site setting "KnowledgeManagement/NotesFilter", which is by default set to **\*WEB\***.
> - The ability to show both notes and [activities](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/view-all-activities-in-portal-timeline) on the same form for a custom table is currently not supported with configuration.

## Notes configuration for basic forms

You can further configure the timeline control to allow site users to add, update, or delete notes and attachments by configuring the form metadata using the Portal Management app. 

1. Open the [Portal Management app](portal-management-app.md)

1. Select **Basic Forms** under **Content** on the left pane.

1. From the list of forms, select to open a record of the form to which you want to add note configuration.

1. From the available tabs in form settings, select **Basic Form Metadata**.

1. Select **New Basic Form Metadata**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-notes/new-form-metadata.png" alt-text="Add new basic form metadata.":::

1. Select **Type** as **Note**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-notes/type-notes.png" alt-text="Type of note.":::

1. The notes configuration settings are displayed. Most of the settings are collapsed by default. You can expand a section to see more settings.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-notes/notes-options.png" alt-text="Note options.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to enable storing note attachments in Azure, you will need to first [enable Azure storage](enable-azure-storage.md) for note attachments as well as update the **File Attachment Location** option to **Azure Blob Storage**.

1. Fill in the fields by entering appropriate values. These settings are explained in more detail below under [Attributes](#attributes), [Create dialog options](#create-dialog-options), [Edit dialog options](#edit-dialog-options), and [Delete dialog options](#delete-dialog-options).

1. Save the form.

After adding the configuration, the note control will be rendered by using the appropriate options enabled on the website.

### Assign table permissions

Notes, and the **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons for the note control will be hidden on the basic or multistep form unless you create and assign the appropriate table permissions to the records as follows:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A user must sign-in and be the creator of the note to edit or delete it using the portal. Users can't edit or delete a note created by others, even if you assign them table permissions.

1. Ensure the **Enable Table Permissions** checkbox is selected on the form for which you want notes to appear. Table permissions are enabled by default on all newly provisioned websites.

1. For the table that has the notes control enabled, create a table permission with the required privileges. The scope should be appropriately set depending on the level of access required to end users.

    For example, create a table permission for a table that shows notes on the basic form, with privileges including **Read**, **Write**, **Create**, **Append**, and **Append To**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-notes/add-table-permissions.png" alt-text="Adding table permissions.":::

1. [Associate the table permission with a web role](../security/assign-table-permissions.md) for the user.

    For example, add the table permission created in the previous step to a web role.

1. Create a [child table permission](../security/table-permissions.md#configure-child-permissions) for the **Annotation** table from the table permission created in step 2 with the required privileges as explained in the table below. 

    | Note action | Required permissions |
    | - | - |
    | **Read** | Read |
    | **Add** | Create, Append (Append To required on Parent Table Permission) |
    | **Edit** | Write |
    | **Delete** | Delete |

    For example, create a child table permission for the Annotation table, with the  table permission created in the previous steps set as the parent table.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-notes/child-permissions.png" alt-text="Configure child permissions.":::

### Enable rich text editor

The rich text editor can be enabled when adding or editing notes on a form on a webpage.

A rich text editor can also be enabled for multiline text fields on a form. See [Tutorial: Configure the rich text editor control on Power Pages](component-rte-tutorial.md) for more information.

1. Open the [Portal Management app](portal-management-app.md).

1. Go to the **Website** section and select **Site Settings**.

1. Select **New** to create a new [site setting](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/configure-site-settings).

1. Specify the following values for the site setting;
    1. **Name:** Timeline/RTEEnabled
    1. **Website:** *The associated website record*
    1. **Value:** True
    1. **Description:** (Optional)

1. Select **Save & Close**

1. Sync your website from the studio and preview the site.

1. You should be able to add and edit notes using the rich text editor.

### Notes created with rich text editor

You can view the notes created using the [Rich text editor control configurations](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/rich-text-editor-control) on your portal webpage. 

However, if the [rich text editor](#enable-rich-text-editor) isn't enabled for notes on forms, when you try to edit, you'll see the text in HTML markup format.

For example, this note shows rich-text format in the model-driven app.

The portal webpage shows the note in rich-text format.

However, when editing the note from the portal webpage, you see the note in HTML markup format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you try to save a note with HTML markup using the portal, you'll receive this error: *We're sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again, and if this persists, contact the website administrator.* To save the notes with HTML markup using the portal, you'll have to disable the request validation. However, disabling request validation applies to the entire website. For the steps to disable the request validation, and to understand its impact, go to [request validation](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/entity-forms#request-validation).

## Notes configuration for multistep forms

Multistep form notes are configured in the same way as [basic form notes](#notes-configuration-for-basic-forms). Create a metadata record for the multistep form Step that has notes first, and then add the notes configuration metadata.

## Enable file attachment on form

Enable **Attach File** option for the **Basic Form** to show the attachment option available with the notes.

To enable attachment on a basic form:

1. Open the [Portal Management app](portal-management-app.md).

1. Select **Basic Forms** under **Content** on the left pane.

1. From the list of forms, select to open a record of the form to which you want to add note configuration.

1. Select **Additional Settings** for the form. Configure the additional settings as per the fields explained in the section below.

### Additional settings for file attachment

| Name | Description
| - | - 
| Attach File | Check the box to enable file attachments on the form.
| Attach File Save Option | Select **Notes** or **Portal Comments** to save file attachments. For notes attachments, select **Notes**.
